# A 3D‑Printed Hand‑Powered Centrifuge for Molecular Biology  

## Acknowledgment

This centrifuge design is a derivative of the open‑source [3D‑fuge project](https://github.com/bhamla-lab/3D-fuge-PlOS-Biology-2019), originally described in:  
> G. Byagathvalli et al. (2019). *A 3D‑printed hand‑powered centrifuge for molecular biology.* PLoS Biol 17(5): e3000251. [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000251](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000251)

We adapted and simplified the original design to improve portability and ease of use in field settings, demonstrating its application for decentralized cell‑free protein biomanufacturing.  
Key modifications include:  
- Replacement of the nut‑and‑bolt closure with a **magnetic locking mechanism**  
- Simplification of assembly for rapid deployment in resource‑limited environments  

The updated design files are provided as:  
- `3D-fuge-Body.stl`  
- `3D-fuge-Top.stl`
